## About Me
I'm a programmer with two AAS degrees from TSTC, one in graphic design and one in computer programming. Currently, I'm searching for a full-time programming job tha will push the limits of my knowledge and provide unique challenges to help me further hone the skills I developed in school. My preferred language is Java, but I also have experience with Python, JavaScript, and C#.
